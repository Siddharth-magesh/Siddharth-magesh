## About Me

I am an AI researcher and engineer focused on the design, training, and deployment of intelligent systems across multiple areas of artificial intelligence. My work combines deep learning theory, model architecture design, and practical system integration, with the goal of building scalable and robust AI systems.

### Research Interests

- Large Language Models and Transformer-based architectures
- Agentic AI systems, autonomous decision-making, and tool-augmented models
- Multimodal learning and vision-language integration
- Representation learning and self-supervised learning
- Training dynamics, optimization methods, and model efficiency
- System-level integration of AI models, including inference pipelines and deployment constraints

I am particularly interested in **agentic and reasoning-capable models** that can plan, interact with tools, maintain state, and operate over extended horizons, bridging the gap between static predictors and adaptive intelligent systems.
